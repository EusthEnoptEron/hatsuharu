# February 2nd (Fri)

I, Atsushi Tomioka, have always known that high school is not that joyful place that anime shows and the like would want to make you believe. The concept of getting your own club rolling, hanging around there with your buddies -- girls and boys -- until dusk is purely fictional and simply a product of lonely light novel writers reveling in their fantasies of a perfect youth. Of course, I had no such expectations whatsoever.

But still...!

"Ugh...!"

Not in my wildest dreams would I have thought that I would not even find someone to talk to. Thanks to that, I have become an expect in pretending to sleep. I could probably blindly tell what season it is just by the temparature of my desk.

Oh, look how cool my desk is. It must be February.

Let me explain myself, though: I *did* have friends when I was a freshman. I was just unlucky enough to end up in a class with next to no familiar faces when I started my second year. On top of that, I missed my chance to make friends with my new classmates at the beginning of the year. That was enough to set my situation in stone. Even when presented with a chance to talk with someone after that, I clench up and fail miserably at keeping up a conversation. Fast forward one month later, all groups have formed and I'm in none of them.

Thus I have become a bookworm, even though I don't have an interest in words.

But hold on, here comes the icing on the cake!

If that wasn't enough, as if to stress how miserable I am, those "fantasies" of a perfect youth actually seem to be true for a considerable part of my class!

Take Takeshi Odagiri for an example; he's just your next guy without any particular traits. After changing classes, I was like "Oh well, 'guess he'll get to be my friend?"

But then…  but motherfucking then!

There's that girl called Suzune Isa who is sitting in front of me. She may look unremarkable at first glance, partly because of her glasses, but when you look closer, you will notice that she's not only pretty but also well stacked. However, while I was looking for a chance to get intimate with her -- because I could tell by the eye-contact she made with me when handing over print-outs that she had a crush in me (surely) -- Odagiri snatched her away. To make matters even worse, Isa has become sexier by the day ever since she has started dating him. No way in hell this girl is pure anymore.

Next, there's that guy called Haruki Mihara. He and Setsuka Sunami, a girl who looks so good it's not even funny, have been head over heels with each other from the get-go. That being said, I would never think of making a move. I would be be perfectly fine if I could appreciate her beauty from afar -- if, and only if, I did not have to watch as that bastard licks all the nectar out of her mouth! Yes, I hate him. I'm jealous! Life's unfair…Dammit! Why can he have such a cute girlfriend?! How does this work?! H-He, he must have used some kind of dirty trick. I wouldn't be surprised if they actually lived under the same roof, for whatever reason, and he brainwashed her into liking him through sexual pleasure! Unforgivable! Curse you, Mihara! I hope you suddenly start losing hair at the age of 25 and suffer from the dread of turning bald!

"Hehe…hehe..."

But so be it. There is one thing that sets me apart from other loners like Suzuki: while I may have no friends, 
I haven't lost contact with the other sex.

As a matter of fact, I might meet *her* today.

With a smirk that would probably even gross out myself if I looked into a mirror, I stand up, tied a hand-made scarf (by my mom) around my neck and slung my school bag over my shoulder.

My thoughts reside with *her*; with her big, entrancing eyes, and her silky skin, and the endless variety of fascinating expressions in her face. Most of all, I recall her unbelievably cute smile that always reminds me of sunflowers. And, and, and...

"Oh, you going home, Atsushi?"

Suddenly, my delusional bubble is popped and I jump up with a flabberghasted "Huh?!" in response to the first time a girl has addressed me in ages.

Huh? What's going on? Is this some kind of misunderstanding or am I hearing ghosts? An auditory illusion, maybe?

No, I clearly heard a girl's voice and there's no other Atsushi in this class.

I turn around like an unoiled robot.

"Aatsuuushii!"

It's a gyaru…a typical white gyaru…I would like to say, but she's not rigged that badly. That said…fluffy permed brown hair with a gaudy ribbon,  a short skirt around her waist, a bag that rattles with rock band badges and little stuffed animals attached all over it -- that's no doubt a gyaru in my book. And for some reason this girl, who is obviously enjoying herself to the fullest, is waving at me with a broad smile.

W-What the heck?

Judging by the confused glances of her equally popular friends, I'm not the only one who thinks that her attitude is coming out of the blue.

I could still understand it if the year had only just started, but now, when the school year's almost over...?

"Bye-bye!" she says while waving her hand, but that's all. She does not seem to want anything from me.

I squeeze out a "Y-Yeah...?" and hurry out of the classroom.

Before I know it, my feet go faster and faster as I walk through the corridor.

C-Calm down! There's no reason to rush it, neither is there a reason to be flustered. Yet, my feet won't stop speeding up to the rhythm of my racing heart.

Did I get my hopes up a little, being so excited? Thinking that my dull youth could change thanks to a white gyaru? Just because she talked to me?

I arrive at my shoe locker. I lean against it with all my weight and try to calm my breath.

Are you an idiot? Don't get your hopes up! My school routine isn't going to change anytime soon. No, it isn't…it is not going to.

I get out of my slippers and put them in the locker in place of my loafers.

"Do you know Marina Mikimo? I think she's a real hottie."

I drop my loafers. Just because I heard her name.

I hate to admit it -- I really do -- but I'm awfully interested in what they are talking about. I jump to the backside of  the lockers and start listening.

Talking is a spectacled guy and a guy with close-cropped hair, both of which I recognize from the class next door.

"Mikimo? That gyaru from class D? Sorry, but I'm totally not into gyarus..."

Get a load of this guy! By acting up like that against a girl he's practically putting his virginity on display.

"Yeah, but the other day she greeted me with a real cute smile, you know? Even though we don't know each other. That was nice of her."

"She's just looking down at you, dude. Showing off how great her life is."

"Man, you have a twisted personality, you know that?"

"You think so? I mean, word has it that she's dating a university student. Someone rich, I think. I bet she doesn't even care about kids like us who don't have their pockets filled with money."

"A university student?! For real? Well, sounds fair enough in her case. That would explain why she wears a watch that looks so darn expensive. Must have gotten it from her rich sweetheart…but that's not the point I'm trying to make. I mean, she *is* cute! I'd totally date her! I'd love to make a grab at those boobies!"

"You obviously don't have any experience. If you don't watch out, you'll end up as the personal wallet of the next girl!"

Again, get a load of this guy! No experience? You're no less virgin than him! (Groundless accusions?)

"Which reminds me---"

They change the subject and walk away.

In the end, they didn't talk about anything worthwhile. Just everyday chatter between two ordinary students. It's unavoidable that people talk about girls who are popular and spread rumors. It's as simple as that.

However---

"A boyfriend in university?" I mutter absent-mindedly and feel uncomfort pressing against me. Kind of as if a bunch of spiders spun their webs in my head, one after another. I can sense my mind become numb with a sticky sensation.

Aah…it's all such a pain. Even lifting my loafers.

I tap one my loafer with my foot and grind my teeth.

Suddenly, Marina's smile crosses my mind.

Yeah, I think so too!

She's cute.



However, since I know better than anyone that I stand no chance, it did not take me long to return to normal.

Well, in this case "normal" means being depressed as always, though.

All alone I walk down a street, surrounded by a freezing cold. I'm sure that I would make a great picture now if you took a photo from afar, walking by myself down a country road. Someone, go up that apartment block over there and take a photo. The title shall be "The Personification of Depression."

Hell, it's cold! My ears have become red and swollen with the cold, except for the part that is covered by the in-ears that I put in there to look as though I enjoyed being alone. I could just as well just jump into the frozen irrigation canal that's flowing alongside the road.

"No…today is not the day I die," I whisper to myself in a theatrical manner.

After all, chances are that I will get to meet *her* if I endure the cold.


"F-Finally...!"

And it really happened!

I'm standing in a filiale of a nationwide rental video store. For the past few weeks, I have come here every day. The store is not very spacious, so there is next to no space between the shelves. Of course, the staff is keeping the place nice and clean, but these narrow ways that don't fit more than one person combined with the peculiar smell of a used goods store gives it an air of shadiness.

And in such a place, I found my angel -- in front of the curtain that leads to the adult corner, right next to the idol DVDs.

"Hatsuharu Rei...!" I gasp as I clutch the package, and suddenly, the store stops feeling shady and instead seems to be shining brightly. Actually, that's not figurative, for there is an angel right before me. It makes sense that this place would transform into heaven in her presence!

"Wow... just, wow...!"

I'm so excited that I start stomping in place rapidly.

Allthrough the past year, I have seen all kinds of Hatsuharu Rei. Be it official art, fanart, videos, fanbooks, cosplayers, and whatnot. In my head, there is a clear image of a perfect Hatsuharu Rei that is controlling my mind. Skin so pure as snow, soft hair that is a mix of white and blue, and eyes with a deep blue that resembles the starry sky. Hatsuharu Rei is the ideal female, pulling of a remarkable balance of modernity, mysteriosity, and feminity.

Countless pictures of my angel cross my mind and say the  words I always picture her saying.

*"Nice to meet you, Atsushi!"*

Oh my god... this is... this is just...!

The bulk girlfriend, Hatsuharu Rei. The latest addition to the family of "bulk girlfriends" that have since become a social phenomenon.

In a nutshell, "bulk girlfriend" is a love simulation software. It is, however, not a game; it's purely a simulation based on realistic romance and can be used for preparing for the real thing.

The bulk girlfriends have been developed by De Noir Ltd., a leading firm in the A.I. field, in collaboration with the Tokyo Institute of Technology. They have used state-of-the-art tech to copy the personalities of real girls into the A.I. of the bulk girlfriends. According to tests they conducted, the average deviation in thought pattern of the model person compared to the A.I. is less than 1%. Apparently, the reason why so much money has flown into developing this tech for the bulk girlfriends, is due to its wide range of applications. It is said that all sorts of AIs will use this technology going forward.

There are many theories regarding why something as down-to-earth as "bulk girlfriends" has been chosen as the driving force of this new tech. The most prominent reason seems to be that it's a decision made by the government. Apparently, some high--up in the diet said in some press conference that having people practice getting in a relationship using a high-quality artificial intelligence will reduce the decline in birth rate. That's quite a bold statement coming from a high-ranking politician. Needless to say, a crossfire against the diet was opened shortly after conference with many people complaining about the waste of money (which is still on-going), but considering the economical impact of the bulk girlfriends, it can be said that they succeeded in making realistic AI a thing in the entertainment sector.

At any rate, right now the bulk girlsfriends who are said to be 2D outside and 3D inside, are mezmerizing us men. Out of the 17 other available girlfriends, Hatsuharu Rei is by far the most popular and probably the first that comes to mind when hearing "bulk girlfriend". It took me a whole month frequenting this rental video shop to find a copy.

"N-Now...!" With heavy, excited breathing, I take out the case of the package and press it against my chest. "Q-Quickly, before someone snatches her awa..."

My breath stops as I turn around.

"See? Didn't I tell you that we'd find a live DVD of Tsuru from the Johnnies J?"

"Wow, you were right! Even though they don't have it anywhere else!"

Girls. From my class, even. Four girls have come to the idol DVD corner right beside me. They're blocking my way out.

I quickly hide Hatsuharu Rei's case behind my back.

She's a character everyone knows, but while she is widely accepted on the Internet and has become a social phenomenon, the acceptance in the real world is still low.

After all, it's a artificial love simulator -- the kind of thing that girls their age hate the most.

If they find me, it's only a matter of time until the whole school knows about it.

*"Tomioka, that creep no one cares about, is so desperate that he got himself a bulk girlfriend." - "Eeew! Gross!" - "But isn't a real girl inside that simulator? I bet he's so gross that she won't let him touch her!" - "Yeah! And then he'll get mad and break the disc... pathetic!" - "But what if that simulator gives him some confidene and he makes a move on us? Wouldn't that be gross?" - "I bet he'd suddenly get cocky and start talking big about girls even though he doesn't know shit... that's so gross..." - "And then when we turn him down, he'll be hurt and turn into a stalker. Gross!"*

Would you please shut up and stop saying "gross", creatures of my mind?!

Ack... if they spread rumors about me, it won't be long until Marina gets wind of it, since she's part of the central group of our class.

I have to avoid that whatever it takes!

"Hm?"

While I was thinking of a solution, one of the girls seemed to recognize me. The other three follow her gaze.

I-Ignore me, please! You always do, right? I-I'm only air! A stone by the wayside! Just some dirt!

And yet, one of the girls feels obliged to talk to me.

"Um... you're from our class, right? Err... Tomi...ta?"

"I-I'm Tomioka."

"Ah, of course, Tomioka... um, so what are you renting?" one of them asks as she approaches me. I'm done for -- they'll start chanting 'gross' any second. My non-existant place at school is going to vanish entirely. Everyday will be an public execution.

There is only one way out.

"I, um, I'm busy right now! See you around!"

I turn around and walk through the curtain. Girls like them shouldn't be able to follow me here.

"Phew..." As I let out a sigh, a huge number of tits leap to my eye. Unfamiliar with this kind of thing, I tense up, but there is no way back now.

"Huh?" - "Did he just, like, enter the adult corner in front of us?" - "Seriously? What a creep..." - "I was still talking with him...! Does that mean he couldn't control his libido?" - "Ew! Gross!" - "...Let's stop talking about him, okay? He's listening over there."

...Strange. Is it just me, or did the outcome not change a lot...? It sounds just the same as I pictured to myself earlier!

Holding back my tears, I listen to the slowly fading voices. I will be the creep in class from today on.

"...sigh..."

With a deep, lamenting sigh, I stare at the boobs in front of me.

As the commendable student I am, this is the first time I've entered the adult corner. It would be a shame not to use this chance to rent a good porn that will help me overcome the nightmare of a school life that is awaiting me.

After a few minutes, I finally decide on which porn I'm going to rent.

*Degraded into the Plaything of my Four Hot Classmates*

"..."

*Could it be that I'm a guy who can make the best of any situation?* I think to myself, somewhat proud of myself.



Ignoring the "welcome home" coming from my mom out of the kitchen, I head upstairs  and into my room. As I enter, I drop my school bag to the floor and throw my uniform onto my bed.

I can't wait...!

In my excitement, I tumble over a pile of Shounen Jump issues, but I shall not care. I make a beeline to my desk and place the things I just rented on it.

Sitting down straight, I take a few deep breaths. Breathe in! Breathe out!

I proceed to taking my loot out of the large nylon bag I carried them in. First there is the head-mounted computer that is used to run the Bulk Girlfriend software and resembles a helmet, then there's the case with the Hatsuharu Rei chip inside. Just lining them up makes my heart beat faster.

They charge you 3800 yen a week for renting a Bulk Girlfriend. It's a steep price for a high school student, but I regret nothing. (By the way, I couldn't rent *Degraded into the Plaything of my Four Hot Classmates* because of the age rating. To make things worse, it was actually a college girl who processed my order. Seeing the look on her face gave me a yet another trauma.)

You can rent any of the Bulk Girlfriends only once. They say that it's to give the love simulation some extra realism. That's also why you cannot buy them.

Sadly, this means that Hatsuharu Rei and I only have a single week together.

After gulping down, I open the lid by the right ear of the head-mounted computer and insert the chip. I then proceed to connecting the device to the Wi-Fi by pressing the WPS button. I finally put on the HMC and adjust the mic.

Switch on.

The next moment, my dirty room disappears from my view.

A light blue fills my view, on which a download progress bar is being displayed.

After a short while, a 2D sprite of a smiling Hatsuharu Rei appears on the screen and asks, "Please answer a few questions!"

What follows is a long series of questions regarding my name, my age, my height, my weight, my blood type, my place of birth, my occupation, my yearly income, my hobbies, my favorite color, my number of girlfriends, my most enjoyable moment in life, my preferences in girls, and so forth. The number of questions exceeds 200.

I answer each and every of them by talking through my mic -- Bulk Girlfriend is operated through voice input. The software *does* support conventional keyboard input, but the speech recognition is rock solid and free of false positives.

After long, I finish answering the last question.

"Now, please take off the computer and point the camera that is located in the center of the headset at yourself."

I take off the HMC as I'm told and fix my hair in front of the next mirror. This recording is very important. Bulk Girlfriends, too, have their own preferences, and now is the moment when she decides whether or not I'm to her liking.

Hatsuharu Rei continues walking me through the setup. "Smile," "Look sad," "Look happy," "Look angry," "Pretend the camera was me."

Following her instructions, I screw my face to all kinds of expressions. Slowly but surely, I'm starting to get anxious that she might dislike my appearance. After all, there is no way that a loner like me can be remotely cool.

However, I can't let these qualms show. I don't want to get any minus points. While trying to keep a blank mind, I continue to change my expression as told.

"Smile one last time."

At last, the facial setup comes to an end, which also concludes the initial setup process.

*Bulk Girlfriend, Hatsuharu Rei* is ready to boot.

"Uuuh...!" I mutter, trembling with excitement. "At last I get to meet her...!"

I put on the head-mounted computer once again and enter the world of Hatsuharu Rei.



Dazzled by the light coming from the visor, I close my eyes.

I'm suddenly encompassed by highly realistic city noise that is being played through the built-in headphones. "Yeah, that guy kicked ass!" - "Sorry to keep you waiting, honey!" - "Did you see that shopgirl? I think I'm in love." - "Hey cutie, have some time? Wanna go grab a bite somewhere?" - "Awwww!" - "Actually, that anime's about" - "Which bar should we go?"

I find myself in the middle of a city as I open my eyes. The stereoscopic imagery is indistinguishable from the real thing.

My brain is overwhelmed by the flood of information caused by the abrupt change of environment. It is only now that I notice that I have been holding my breath. After taking a deep breath of air, my heart starts to pound faster with excitement.

"....phew..."

I wonder if this is what it feels like if you could teleport into the city?

Having finally gotten a grip on myself, I look around. Some people seem to be in a hurry, others are absent-mindedly toying with their smartphones. Behind me I discover an art object of an owl that is likely to serve as a meeting point.

I try recalling the setting that was given to me. I'm one year older than Hatsuharu Rei and a second-year student in a different high school from her. I spotted her on my way to school and begged a female friend of mine who is also friends with her to set us up.

Today, we Hatsuharu Rei and I are going to town together.

I see. As someone who has no friends, let alone female friends, this could never happen in real life!

I almost fall into a depression in face of the unforgiving reality, but I manage to regain my composure. Let's get things straight. The virtual time is 10:30am. We agreed to meet at 11:00am, so there's still half an hour left.

Does this mean that I have to wait here for about half an hour? Well, surely I would come this early for a real date with her, but is there really a need to be that real?

However, my concerns are cleared away as I look ahead: Blue and white twin tails I have seen countless times in magazines and on the web, swaying gently in the wind. Big eyes, anxiously searching for someone.

*A-Are you kidding me?*

Because the scenery is very close to reality and she isn't real, I thought that she would stand out. However, for some reason I can't explain, she does not. The developers must have fine-tuned everything to just work.

That being said -- while this may sound contradicting -- she hasn't blended into the scenery. She is clearly special. She has been designed to be the main character of this world.

I once had the chance to lay my eye on a famous actress; she was so beautiful I couldn't believe we were of the same species. So much so, that I was convicted that God is discriminating us. This, however, is even a greater shock. Of course, there is no way that she wouldn't shine in a world that was made for her.

My skin tickles as if under electricity, emcompassed by her overwhelming aura. My lungs feel oppressed, I can't breathe well.

I'm about to go on a date with her...?

How am I to survive this...?!

That said, I can't just keep standing here like a stick or else I'll fail this love simulation right from the get-go.

Gulping down my anxiety and excitement, I walk around the owl statue where she's waiting at and greet her.

"Urm, nice to meet you," I manage to say normally.

Her eyes widen as she looks at me. She's so cute!

"...? Ah, could it be that you're Atsushi...?"

Seeing me nod, Hatsuharu Rei flashes a dazzling smile.


"Nice to meet you, Atsushi!"


This line!

I was waiting for this very line!

This very line that I've seen countless times on Nico Nico Douga!

"F-FUUUUUUUUUCK YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAH!!!" I shout out, unable to contain my excitement any longer.

Forget it! I'm not gonna stay calm when I finally get to hear that famous line, with my name tagged to it!! YAAAAAAAAY!!!

"Uhm... huh? W-What's up with that reaction...?" Rei Hatsuharu stutters in a frightened manner.

"Oh." Dammit.

No wonder she's frightened -- I may know everything about her, but that's not the case the other way around. I would be just as frightened if a stranger let out a thrilled shout upon seeing me.

Quick! I have to make up for it...!

"Cough!"

I straighten my face as I clear my throat. The HMC is capable of reading my expression, so she knows that I'm making a straight face.

"Nevermind -- just a little seizure. I have an illness, you see."

"Y-You do...? My condolences."

Let's change the topic.

"Anyway. You're thirty minutes early, Hatsuharu."

"So are you, Atsushi. I was surprised to find you here already!" she says and suddenly flashes an embarassed smile. "Ah, I'm sorry. Yoko told me to call your name, but now that I think about it, that may have been inappropriate..."

Yoko is our common acqaintance. She is purely imaginary, of course; I do not have such a friend in real life. ... Is there a problem with that?!

"No, it's completely fine! Just call me Atsushi!"

"Are you sure? So I didn't act off or anything?"

"More like, I'd love you to call me by my first name."

"Oh," she cheerfully laughs. "Then Atushi it is."

"Ah..." This smile! I've seen it a thousand times! It's that super cute smile that made her appear everywhere!

WOOOAAAAH!! SHE'S SUPER CUTE MAN!!!

I try to calm my rampaging emotions -- if I were to show my excitement now, I'd commit the same mistake as before. There is no room for any more of these.

Just barely I manage to keep a straight face.

"Why is your mouth twitching?"

Barely not, I guess.

"Um... how should I call you, Hatsuharu?"

"Oh, call me whatever you like!"

"I see... how about Rei-chan?"<!-- TODO -->

"Um yeah, no."

Sigh.

"Just kidding, just kidding! You can call me that if you want!" she laughs as she points at her rounded cheeks.

I'm in love with her playful style. It fits her character perfectly.

"..."

However, I did catch on to where she was coming from.

"How about Haruchii?" I suggest.

"Hm?"

"You don't like being called Rei-chan, do you? Then how about Haruchii?"

She keeps silent, still smiling.

"Um... should I take that as a no?"
